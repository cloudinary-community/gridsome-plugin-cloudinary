To set configurations for Cloudinary source plugin, we use inner `options` section of the `gridsome-transformer-img` in `gridsome.config.js`.

The list of available options are shown as below

### `cloudName` - Required

* Type: `String`
* `required`

The cloud name associated with your Cloudinary account. It is used to configure and enable Cloudinary features such as generating delivery asset URL. 

```js
/* gridsome.config.js */

export default {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: 'gridsome-transformer-img',
      options: {
        cloudName: 'your-cloud-name'
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

Cloud name presents in every delivered URL from Cloudinary, hence it's important to have it configured correctly.

You can find your cloud name details in **Dashboard** page, or in **Account Settings** page in [Cloudinary console](https://cloudinary.com/console)

### `apiKey` - Required

* Type: `String`
* `required`

The API Key associated with your Cloudinary account. It is used together with `apiSecret` to query images and videos from your Cloudinary account to GraphQL Data Layer.

```js
/* gridsome.config.js */

export default {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: 'gridsome-transformer-img',
      options: {
        apiKey: 'your-api-key'
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

You can find your API Key in your **Cloudinary Dashboard** page, or in **Settings/Security** page in [Cloudinary console](https://cloudinary.com/console)

## `secure`

* Type: `Boolean`

export default {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: 'gridsome-transformer-img',
      options: {
        secure: false
      }
    },

}
```

```js
/* gridsome.config.js */

export default {
  plugins: [
